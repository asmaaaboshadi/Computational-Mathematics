Part I: Applications of Linear Algebra:
Choose one of the following topics:


 Geometric Image Transformations:
 
Linear algebra plays an essential role in digital image processing. One of its uses is geometric transformation of images.
Based on your knowledge of linear transformations, explore the different geometric linear transformations in R2 such as
rotation, shear, reflection and scaling. Explain how the transformation matrices associated with these transformations
can be applied to images. Write a simple MATLAB code that applies these transformations to any image file of your
choice.

 
 Cryptography:
 
Linear algebra can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages. A simple example is the Hill cipher. Explain how the
Hill cipher works and how linear algebra is involved in encryption and decryption. You will also need to include a
brief explanation of modular arithemetic, which is needed to understand how the Hill cipher works. Write a simple
MATLAB code that implements encryption and decryption using the Hill cipher.
For this part, prepare a presentation on the selected topic. Submit a video narrating your presentation. You should also
upload the presentation itself (in PDF format). The video should be either .mp4, .wmv or Matroska (.mkv). You can also
upload your video to YouTube as an unlisted video. ALL team members are required to speak during the presentation (do
not present yourself before speaking, just put the name of each team member on their assigned slides).



Part II: Numerical Methods:

Write a simple MATLAB code that implements linear regression (for the linear, exponential, power, and growth rate
models). The inputs of the code should be the data (the x and y values) and the required model. The outputs should be a
figure showing the data points and the least squares fit for the four models, as well as the values of the model coefficients and
the coefficient of determination r2. Test your code on any data set, and based on the results, your code should decide which
model best fits your data. Prepare a report that includes screenshots of your codes and a sample run (input and output of
the code, screenshots of the command window, and the figure).
